1,BD_001,Extra Fields on Create Account Page Not in Figma Design,"The ""Create Account"" page on the website includes several form elements that are not present in the approved Figma design. These extra fields create a mismatch between the implemented UI and the design specification.

,BD_002,Homepage Not Accessible After Incomplete Registration — URL Loads Last Registration Step,"When a user starts the registration process but exits before completion, re-entering the main website URL in the browser does not load the home page. Instead, it resumes from the last incomplete registration step, which may confuse users who intend to start over or access general information.","1. Start the registration process on the website.
2. Exit the process midway (e.g., by closing the tab or browser).
3. Reopen the browser and manually enter the website’s base URL.
4. Observe the page that loads.","- System automatically resumes the registration process from where the user left off.

2,BD_003,First Name and Last Name Fields Accept Numeric and Special Character Inputs Without Validation,"The system allows users to register using numeric characters (e.g., ""123456"") and special characters (e.g., ""@#%&"") in the First Name and Last Name fields. This violates basic input validation standards for name fields, which are expected to accept only alphabetical characters.","1. Open the website
2. Click on the create account button.
2. In the ""First Name"" field, enter: 1234567890
3. In the ""Last Name"" field, enter: @#%&

3,BD_004,System Allows Registration with Single-Letter in First and Last Names,"The registration form permits users to register using only a single character in both the First Name and Last Name fields (e.g., ""A"" and ""B""). This violates typical form validation standards that require a minimum of 2 characters for name fields. Allowing single-letter names can result in poor data quality and may affect downstream systems relying on user details.","1. Open the website

There is no validation to enforce a strong password policy requiring a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This significantly reduces password strength and compromises user account security.","1. Navigate to the ""Create Account"" page.
2. In the password field, enter one of the following:
    - abcdef (only alphabets)
   - 12345678 (only numbers)
   - @#$%^&* (only special characters)

7,BD_008,Password Field Does Not Display Hint or Guidelines for Password Requirements,"When a user focuses on or hovers over the password input field on the ""Create Account"" page, no tooltip, placeholder, or helper text is shown to guide users on the required password format.

This violates typical formatting and length standards for phone numbers and may cause issues with data storage, formatting, and backend systems expecting valid phone number lengths.","1. Navigate to the ""Create Account"" page.
2. Locate the phone number input field.
3. Enter a long numeric string like 12345678901234567890.

15,BD_016,User Can Access Dashboard Without Completing Onboarding Process,"After account creation, users are expected to complete an onboarding process (e.g., personal details, preferences, or verification) before gaining access to the dashboard. However, the system intermittently allows users to bypass this onboarding and land directly on the dashboard or displays the dashboard before navigating to the personal details page.
